Senior Project for College

This is a team-based project. The task is to design a web application for a non-profit that utilizes a database to keep track of information such as membership, donations, and employees.

The "Testing" folders are rough designs for the different modules that make up the web application.

"News" sorts and pulls the three most recent news articles and displays them in a table. This will be utilized on the front page of the non-profit website. There is a back-end for this as well which features a form that uploads a news article into the database. Potential ideas for expansion here: generating the "Author" name based on the person that is logged in and connecting committees, which would allow someone to post a news article that only authorized people can view.

"Calendar" is a single-page calendar of events that are organized by month and day. The code is written to organize these events by month and not display months that have no events scheduled. There is a back-end system planned that will allow employees to create, edit, and delete events from the system.

connection.php (which connects to the database) is not included in this repository.
