Senior Project for College

This is a team-based project. The task is to design a web application for a non-profit that utilizes a database to keep track of information such as membership, donations, and employees.

The "Testing" folders are rough designs for the different modules that make up the web application.

connection.php (which connects to the database) is not included in this repository.
